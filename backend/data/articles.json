The video, created by stitching together footage from different times and adding AI-generated elements, caused immediate condemnation and loss of endorsements. The athlete spent millions on legal defense and forensic experts who eventually proved the video was fabricated, but the damage to their reputation and career had already occurred.",

    "content": "Scammers used AI voice cloning to impersonate an elderly grandmother, calling her family and pleading for ransom money, claiming she had been kidnapped. The call, which perfectly mimicked her voice, accent, and speech patterns, convinced family members to wire money before they could verify her safety. The real grandmother was found safe at home, unaware of the call. The incident was part of a broader trend of 'virtual kidnapping' scams using AI voice cloning.",

The video, which used face-swapping technology to place the candidate's face on another person, spread rapidly on social media and was amplified by opponents. Forensic analysis by multiple news organizations confirmed it was a deepfake, but not before early voting had already been affected. The candidate lost by a narrow margin.",
